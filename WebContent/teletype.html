					+ "we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, "
					+ "to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so "
					+ "nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before "
					+ "us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they "
					+ "gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall "
					+ "not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- "
					+ "and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the "
