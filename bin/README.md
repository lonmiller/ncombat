ncombat
=======
ncombat is an effort to re-engineer the mainframe game COMBAT as it appeared on the MECC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECC) mainframe in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Though we do not have original source code, we do have the player documentation and original thermal paper printouts.

Project goals include:

1. Keep interface simple - emphasis on text-only.
2. Keep command and player interaction as close to original as possible.
3. See NCombatRules, ToDosAndThoughts, ProjectLog

See the Developer Quick Start [https://github.com/ncombat/ncombat/wiki/Developer-Quick-Start] for setup and configuration instructions.
